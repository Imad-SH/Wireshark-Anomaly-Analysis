⚪This repository contains a collection of mini-projects focused on analyzing network traffic to identify unusual patterns and behaviors. Each project demonstrates packet inspection skills and familiarity with core networking protocols.

## 📄 Overview

Using Wireshark, multiple traffic samples were analyzed to explore how data flows across networks and to detect anomalies such as irregular HTTP activity, file uploads, scanning behavior, or suspicious communication patterns.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Wireshark
- TCP stream analysis
- Display filters
- Network protocol decoding

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder represents a standalone analysis project and follows this structure:

- `traffic.pcap` – Sample network capture (anonymized)
- `analysis/` – Notes and observations from the investigation
- `screenshots/` – Key packet captures highlighting notable traffic
- `report.pdf` – Summary report of findings and conclusions

## 🚀 Purpose

These projects are part of a self-guided learning path in network analysis and blue-team cybersecurity practices. They are intended to reinforce practical skills in traffic inspection, threat detection, and documentation.
