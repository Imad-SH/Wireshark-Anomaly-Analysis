# 🕵️ Project 01 – CyberDefenders CTF Challenge

## 🧠 Scenario

A suspicious file was identified on a company web server, triggering internal alerts. The Development team flagged this anomaly, suspecting potential malicious activity. In response, the Network team captured key traffic and generated a PCAP file for forensic analysis.

My task: Analyze the provided PCAP file to determine **how the file appeared on the server**, whether it involved **unauthorized access or data exfiltration**, and assess the scope of the incident.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze network traffic to identify the method used to upload the suspicious file
- Determine whether any known attack patterns are present (e.g., file upload, reverse shell)
- Document any indicators of compromise (IOCs) found in the PCAP
- Summarize your findings with screenshots and evidence
